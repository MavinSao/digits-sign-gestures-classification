# Digit Hand Sign Detection

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can detect and classify digit hand signs from images. The model is trained to recognize the digits 0 through 9 based on hand gestures.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main files and directories:

- `data_reader.py`: Script for reading and preprocessing image data.
- `main.py`: Script for training the model with hand sign images.
- `play.py`: Script for real-time hand sign detection using a webcam.
- `digit-classification-model`: Directory where the trained model is saved.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Mediapipe (optional for alternative hand detection)
